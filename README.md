# ibraheem-math-game
This react game is a functional component and is using hooks. It outputs a random single digit multiplication question and the 4 potential answers. 
Only 1 is correct and the one correct is moved around so that is's not always in the same box. 
There is 60 seconds before the time runs out and it's game over. 
Every question correct, you gain a point and every question wrong, you lose a point unless the score is 0. 
Then you don't lose any points so as not to go into negative numbers. 
There is a reset button which allows you to go back to the start page. 
When the timer runs out, there is a game over screen and a play again button.
